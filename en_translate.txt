Hello! I can't really say which is my favorite game right now, but I like Honkai Star Rail and Valorant.
Honkai appeals to users for its diversity. This game has well-developed characters, good voice acting, interesting quests, an open world and much more.
The cool thing about Valorant is that you always have to be alert, listen and act quickly. Also, there are many characters (agents) with different skills, which allows you to diversify the game and excite players even more.
Thank you for attention!
